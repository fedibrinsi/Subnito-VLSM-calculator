# Subnito-VLSM-calculator

Subnito is a smart and intuitive VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) calculator built to make subnetting fast, accurate, and hassle-free.
With traditional subnetting, networks are often split into equal-sized blocksâ€”leading to wasted IP addresses. VLSM solves this by allowing different subnet sizes within the same network, giving you greater flexibility and efficiency in IP allocation.
Subnito helps you:
Calculate optimal subnets based on your IP and host requirements.
Visualize IP ranges, subnet masks, broadcast addresses, and more.
Save time and avoid manual errors in subnetting tasks.
Learn and apply efficient network design principles.
Whether you're a networking student, sysadmin, or IT professional, Subnito is your go-to tool for clean, precise subnet planning.
Subnet smart. Subnet fast. Subnet with Subnito.
